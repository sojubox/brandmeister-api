**BrandMeister**
# RESTful API code repository

### About the project
 [BrandMeister](http://brandmeister.network) is an Open Source ham radio project whose aim is the creation of a free bundle of  network infrastrucures and services.

The project was conceived upon the basis of **DMR** radio networking plus a set of computer services that expands radio service over IP networking.

> **[DMR](http://www.dmrassociation.org) (Digital Mobile Radio)** is an [ETSI specification](http://dmrassociation.org/the-dmr-standard/) for professional mobile radio (PMR) that's being actively adapted to the ham radio service by ham radio operators worldwide. 

BrandMeister project's success relies on collaboration, thus the existance of this and other related repositories of Open Source code. By the time being, global main features of this project are:

 * Basic ETSI-like DMR functionality adapted to ham radio service (that means basically the network is 100% operational and vendor-independent).
 * Complete voice funcionality (two Time Slots, many Talk Groups routerd and addressed, at the time, among countries).
 * Basic short messaging inter/intra Time Slot functionality.
 * (partial) Support for D-Star (by means of inter-platform gateways)
 * (uncompleted) Support for 100% terminal independence.
 * PC-based services by means of DV4 dongles/PCBs. 

Many other functionalities are planned to be achieved in the short, middle and long term. Among them, we can mention, respectively:

 * New Self-Care portal system.
 * Support for homebrew digital repeaters.
 * Support for Icom D-Star (complete support).
 * Support for Echolink (analogue source)
 * Support for Yaesu System Fusion. 

### Main repository's content
The main repository for all BranMeister code is placed [here, on GitHub](https://github.com/brandmeister). 

### This repository's content
This is the personal repository of [EA1HET](http://www.ea1het.com) (Jonathan), who, into the BrandMeister's Development Team, is working on backend and RESTful API services. 

This repository holds master and develop branches from the RESTful API services. **This repository should not be treated as a reliable source of code**. Instead you should be using [the main repository](https://github.com/brandmeister/).

### Stuff used to make this backend & RESTful API services:

 * [Python](http://www.python.org/) programming language.
 * [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), a Python micro-framework.
 * [stackedit.io](https://stackedit.io/editor) for Markdown parsing and text processing.
 * A lot of coffee & patience :)
